# pygame-flags
Using PyGame to (poorly) generate the flags of countries around the world
This may be some of the worst code ever written, but it was fun, so enjoy!
flagSwitcher.py cycles through the flags in the Flags folder, but each of the flags can be individually displayed 

Also tried to explain some of the meanings behind the flags, but not sure how accurate it is.
